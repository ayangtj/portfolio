        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>Our client was experiencing a significant drop-off within the first 7 days after user sign-up, despite initial strong acquisition metrics. We needed to understand why users weren't continuing to engage with the platform after initial exposure.</p>

          <li>Quantitative analysis of user behavior during the first 30 days</li>
          <li>Journey mapping of new user experiences</li>
          <li>30 user interviews with both active and churned users</li>
          <li>Competitive analysis of onboarding flows in similar products</li>
          <li>A/B testing of different onboarding variations</li>

          <li>Value proposition was unclear after initial sign-up</li>
          <li>Users didn't understand how to customize their experience for their specific needs</li>
          <li>First session quality was the strongest predictor of long-term retention</li>
          <li>Re-engagement tactics were missing key motivational elements</li>
        </ul>
