        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In 2024, I worked with a leading healthcare technology company to improve their AI-powered clinical decision support platform. This artificial intelligence (AI) platform enables healthcare networks and clinicians to optimize care delivery through predictive analytics. It is designed to help hospital networks reduce costs while maintaining high-quality care standards.</p>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Despite significant technological capabilities, the platform faced <strong>low adoption rates</strong> among clinicians. The primary challenges included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Workflow integration issues</strong> - The AI tools weren't seamlessly fitting into existing clinical workflows</li>
          <li><strong>Trust barriers</strong> - Clinicians were hesitant to rely on AI-generated insights for patient care decisions</li>
          <li><strong>Value perception gap</strong> - The platform's benefits weren't clearly understood in relation to clinical outcomes</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Understand the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of clinicians' jobs</li>
          <li>Identify key moments where AI could provide meaningful support in the clinical workflow</li>
          <li>Discover unmet needs that would drive adoption of AI-assisted decision making</li>
        </ol>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Research Methods</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contextual Inquiry</strong> - Observing clinicians in their work environment</li>
          <li><strong>JTBD Interviews</strong> - Focused on understanding the jobs clinicians are trying to accomplish</li>
          <li><strong>Journey Mapping</strong> - Documenting the end-to-end clinical decision process</li>

        <h2>Jobs To Be Done Framework Implementation</h2>
        <p>We applied the <strong>Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) framework</strong> to uncover the underlying motivations and goals of clinicians, beyond just their functional tasks. This approach helped us understand:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What "jobs" clinicians were "hiring" various tools to accomplish</li>
          <li>The circumstances that triggered the need for assistance</li>
          <li>The desired outcomes from both functional and emotional perspectives</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="insight-item">
          <h3>1. Make confident decisions with incomplete information</h3>
          <p><strong>Job: Reduce decision-making uncertainty</strong></p>
          <p>Clinicians regularly face situations where they must make decisions without all the ideal information available.</p>
          <p><strong>Pain point:</strong> Anxiety about missing critical factors that could affect patient outcomes</p>
          <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "I'm often making decisions based on partial information and limited time. What keeps me up at night is worrying I've missed something important."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="insight-item">
          <h3>2. Stay current with evolving medical knowledge</h3>
          <p><strong>Job: Maintain expertise without overwhelming time investment</strong></p>
          <p>Clinicians struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of medical research while managing full patient loads.</p>
          <p><strong>Pain point:</strong> Fear of falling behind on latest treatments and protocols</p>
          <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "It's impossible to read everything in my field. I need ways to quickly understand what new research actually matters for my patients."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="insight-item">
          <h3>3. Demonstrate evidence-based reasoning for decisions</h3>
          <p><strong>Job: Build trust with patients and colleagues</strong></p>
          <p>Clinicians need to justify their decisions with clear rationales to various stakeholders.</p>
          <p><strong>Pain point:</strong> Difficulty articulating complex medical reasoning quickly</p>
          <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "Patients want to know why I'm recommending something, and I need to explain complex decisions in terms they can understand and trust."</p>

        <h2>Platform Redesign Principles</h2>
        <p>Our JTBD research informed several key design principles for the platform redesign:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Workflow integration first</strong> - AI features must fit naturally within existing clinical processes</li>
          <li><strong>Transparent reasoning</strong> - Always show the evidence and logic behind AI recommendations</li>
          <li><strong>Progressive disclosure</strong> - Present information in layers of increasing detail as needed</li>
          <li><strong>Human-AI collaboration</strong> - Position AI as enhancing rather than replacing clinical judgment</li>
          <li><strong>Contextual relevance</strong> - Ensure insights are specific to the patient's unique situation</li>
        </ol>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Learnings & Reflection</h2>
        <p>The Jobs To Be Done framework provided crucial insights that a traditional feature-focused approach would have missed. By understanding the deeper motivations and contexts of clinical decision-making, we were able to reposition the AI platform as a trusted assistant rather than a mysterious algorithm.</p>
        <p>Key learnings from this project include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Healthcare AI adoption requires addressing emotional needs (confidence, trust) as much as functional ones</li>
          <li>Clinicians are willing to embrace AI that respects their expertise while reducing cognitive load</li>
          <li>Explaining AI reasoning in clinical terms rather than technical ones significantly increases trust</li>
          <li>Different clinical specialties have unique JTBD profiles that require tailored approaches</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Building on the success of this initial redesign, the team is now:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Expanding the JTBD research to additional clinical specialties</li>
          <li>Developing specialty-specific AI modules based on unique workflow needs</li>
          <li>Creating an integrated feedback loop that continuously improves AI recommendations based on clinician input</li>
          <li>Exploring ways to extend the platform's value by connecting clinician jobs with patient jobs</li>
