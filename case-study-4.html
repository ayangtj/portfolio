          <p><span>1. Improve and automate data pipelines, with dashboard reflecting data health.</span></p>
          <p>Job - Trust the data before modeling</p>
          <p>Motivation: Users need confidence and efficiency to make sure the data they work with is healthy.</p>
          <p>Pain point: Data scientists spend almost 70% of the time fix mismatched data from EHRs and claims systems, often feeling anxiety about data quality.  </p>
        </div>
        <div style='margin-bottom: 40px'>
          <p><span>2. Embed explanation into model outputs to increase the interpretability and explainability, translate technical predictions into actionable business narratives.</span></p>
          <p>Job - Explain the data</p>
          <p>Motivation: Users need to persuade stakeholders (e.g., executives, regulators) that premiums are both fair and profitable.</p>
          <p>Pain point: Reporting to stakeholders is an important part of actuaries' workflow, unexplained models erode trust. Stakeholders demand transparency to ensure fairness, compliance, and accountability.</p>
        </div>
        <div style='margin-bottom: 40px'>
          <p><span>3. Introduce collaboration hubs for seamless collaboration and feedback loops.</span></p>
          <p>Job - Collaborate cross-functionally</p>
          <p>Motivation: Users work with cross-functional teams to refine premium predictions to share back, align assumptions, and track changes so that they can make decisions faster without errors from miscommunication or version conflicts.</p>
          <p>Pain point: “We email Excel files back and forth and hope nothing breaks.”</p>

            <ol>
              <li><span>Strategic product roadmap prioritization</span> - Insights revealed that the target users prioritize data trust and explainability, shifting from consulting to self-serve. </li>
              <li><span>User centric design foundation</span> - Insights informed role-specific user needs, reducing guess work and future rework. </li>
              <li><span>Foundation for human-entered AI design</span> - Insights informed that AI should augment human expertise, not replace judgment, which laid down a solid foundation for future work related to AI - AI’s success isn’t measured by how smart it seems, but by how well it serves the humans who rely on it.</li>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>While utilizing the <span>Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)</span> framework  worked really well in prioritizing user jobs over feature lists kept the team aligned on high-impact solutions, I'd propose to follow up with a <span>quantitative study</span> measuring user perceived importance to inform a phased rollout of new features for progressive adoption.</p>
