        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In 2023, Brave developed its native AI assistant (Leo) to enhance the browser experience. This artificial intelligence (AI) platform enables users to optimize healthcare delivery through predictive analytics. It is designed to help hospital networks and clinicians reduce costs while maintaining high-quality care through predictive analytics.</p>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>The current system is in its early stage and requires <strong>significant UI support</strong>, making users reluctant to adopt. This resulted in low engagement with AI features due to a lack of understanding of how they could be useful. The challenge was to identify <strong>meaningful use cases</strong> and improve the <strong>system usability</strong> and the overall user experience.</p>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h2>Stakeholder Alignment</h2>
        <p>I met with the product manager, product designers, data scientists, and engineering team members to align everyone on the research objectives and approach. We established a shared understanding of key AI capabilities and limitations to frame our research questions effectively.</p>
