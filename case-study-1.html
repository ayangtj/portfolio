            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>In 2023, as generative AI took the tect industry by storm, the board and the executive team decided to jump on the opportunity to integrate this emerging technology to make our product <span class='yellow'>competitive</span> and for the <span class='yellow'>long-term development</span>.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Constraints</h2>
            <p>Time! The board and the executive team want to release the features soon to gain market awareness and stand out among competitors. We had 3-4 months to ship and early version of Brave Leo AI.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>MVP Approach</h2>
            <p>With the constraints in mind, the team decided to build an early version of Leo that provides the <span class='yellow'>most wide use cases</span> while simultaneously exploring heavy-lifting tasks. After MVP, we will continue with more backend building incorporating users, system, and the evolution of the technology itself.</p>

        <h2>Leo Research Roadmap</h2>
        <p>As we moved on to develop Brave Leo AI, I also developed and maintained a research roadmap based on</p>
        <ol>

            <p><em>To navigate the ambiguity in the early version, I met with the key stakeholders - product, design, ML engineers, and later on marketing, to understand their thoughts, concerns, and assumptions. I also conducted competitor analysis and secondary study to gain a deeper understanding of this space. All of the above helped framing the objectives of the research.</em></p>

          <li>Help users effectively collaborate with AI. (i.e. prompt-enhancer, pre-set elements, etc)</li>
          <li>Enhance AI's personalization to bring users more value. (i.e. is it possible to upload writing samples? feed specific details?)</li>

            <p style='font-size: small; margin-top: 75px;'>e.g. to improve Leo's personalization, the short term solution is to provide canned options of tones, length, and actions for users to choose from; the long term solution is to figure out how we can make the model learn and understand unique user's writing style.</p>

I feel like the product strategy would’ve been different. But given the time constraint, I believe this was the best approach.  </p>
