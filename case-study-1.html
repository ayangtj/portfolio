        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The healthcare industry relies heavily on data-driven decisions, yet many healthcare providers struggle with disconnected data systems and inefficient processes. This case study examines how we developed a comprehensive AI-powered data platform to help healthcare organizations better understand patient needs, optimize operations, and improve outcomes.</p>

        <h2>Research Approach</h2>
        <p>We conducted extensive user research to understand the jobs to be done for different healthcare stakeholders. This included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>15+ in-depth interviews with healthcare administrators, physicians, and analysts</li>
          <li>Competitive analysis of existing healthcare analytics solutions</li>
          <li>Contextual inquiry sessions observing current workflow processes</li>
          <li>Jobs-to-be-done framework analysis to identify key user needs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>Our research revealed several critical insights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Healthcare professionals spent 40% of their time searching for and compiling data</li>
          <li>Existing systems provided backward-looking analysis but lacked predictive capabilities</li>
          <li>Decision-makers struggled to translate complex data into concrete action plans</li>
          <li>Teams needed collaborative tools to align on data interpretations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solution & Impact</h2>
        <p>Based on our research, we designed and developed a unified healthcare analytics platform that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Consolidated multiple data sources into a single, intuitive dashboard</li>
          <li>Implemented predictive AI models to forecast patient outcomes and resource needs</li>
          <li>Created role-specific interfaces for different stakeholders</li>
          <li>Developed collaborative tools for team-based decision making</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The platform resulted in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>32% reduction in time spent gathering and analyzing data</li>
          <li>18% improvement in resource allocation efficiency</li>
          <li>Positive feedback from 87% of users on the platform's usability</li>
        </ul>
