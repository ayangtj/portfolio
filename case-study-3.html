        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>As AI assistants become integrated into browsers, Brave wanted to develop Leo - an AI companion focused on privacy and user control. This case study covers the foundational research that shaped Leo's MVP features and design.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>Brave needed to understand how users would interact with an AI assistant within their privacy-focused browser. Key questions included what features would provide the most value, how to balance convenience with privacy, and how to differentiate from competitors.</p>

        <h2>Research Approach</h2>
        <p>We conducted a comprehensive research program including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>20 in-depth interviews with existing Brave users across different technical proficiency levels</li>
          <li>Competitive analysis of browser-integrated AI assistants</li>
          <li>Feature prioritization workshop with stakeholders</li>
          <li>Concept testing of 3 different interaction models</li>
          <li>Privacy sensitivity assessment for AI features</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>Our research revealed several important insights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users valued transparency about when and how AI was being used</li>
          <li>The ability to control data sharing on a per-session basis was highly desired</li>
          <li>Context-aware help (understanding the current webpage) was the most valued potential feature</li>
          <li>Users were skeptical of AI responses and wanted verification options</li>
          <li>Integration with existing Brave features like Shields was expected</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recommendations & Impact</h2>
        <p>Based on our research, we recommended several key features for the Leo MVP:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear indication when Leo is active and what data it can access</li>
          <li>Granular privacy controls accessible directly from the Leo interface</li>
          <li>Contextual awareness with source citations for information</li>
          <li>Integration with Brave Search for verification</li>
          <li>Progressive disclosure of advanced features</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Results after beta launch:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>87% of test users activated Leo at least once</li>
          <li>72% continued using Leo after first week</li>
          <li>Privacy controls were actively adjusted by 63% of users</li>
          <li>Context-aware features received highest satisfaction ratings</li>
        </ul>
